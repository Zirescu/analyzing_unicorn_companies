# Description
Adaptation of the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) [Analyzing Unicorn Companies](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1531) project using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). 

In the related Jupyter Notebook the original project description is provided along with setting up the DuckDB environment and tables. 
My methodology for breaking down the problem into smaller steps and analysis of the provided solution is included.  

## Project Description
Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe!

Using a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database you’ll be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! You’ll find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021!
